      <h1 class="text-center">Authentication</h1>
      <p>Django comes with a user authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, 
          permissions and cookie-based user sessions.The Django authentication system handles both authentication and authorization. Briefly, authentication verifies a user is who they claim to be, and authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
           Here the term authentication is used to refer to both tasks. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Installation</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Authentication support is bundled as a Django contrib module in <strong>django.contrib.auth</strong>. By default, the required configuration is already included in the <strong>settings.py</strong>  generated by <strong>django-admin startproject</strong> , these consist of two items listed in your <strong>INSTALLED_APPS</strong>  setting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>'django.contrib.auth'</strong>  contains the core of the authentication framework, and its default models.</li>
                <li><strong>'django.contrib.contenttypes'</strong>is the Django content type system, which allows permissions to be associated with models you create.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and these items in your <strong>MIDDLEWARE</strong> setting:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>SessionMiddleware</strong> manages sessions across requests.</li>
                <li><strong>AuthenticationMiddleware</strong> associates users with requests using sessions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-center">User Object</h3>
            <br>
            <p>User objects are the core of the authentication system. They typically represent the people interacting with your site and are used to enable things like restricting access, registering user profiles, associating content with creators etc. Only one class of user exists in Django’s authentication framework, i.e., 'superusers' or admin 'staff' users are just user objects with special attributes set, not different classes of user objects.</p>
            <ul>The primary attributes of the default user are:
                <li>username</li>
                <li>password</li>
                <li>email</li>
                <li>first_name</li>
                <li>last_name</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Creating User</h4>
            <p>The most direct way to create users is to use the included create_user() helper function.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong> user = User.objects.create_user('john', 'lennon@thebeatles.com', 'johnpassword')</p>

            <h4>Creating Superusers</h4>
            <p>Create superusers using the createsuperuser command:</p>
            <p>python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com</p>

            <h4>Authenticating users</h4>
            <p><strong>authenticate(request=None, **credentials)</strong></p>
            <p>Use authenticate() to verify a set of credentials. It takes credentials as keyword arguments, username and password for the default case, checks them against each authentication backend, and returns a User object if the credentials are valid for a backend. If the credentials aren’t valid for any backend or if a backend raises PermissionDenied, it returns None.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Permissions and Authorization</h3>
            
            <p>Django comes with a built-in permissions system. It provides a way to assign permissions to specific users and groups of users.</p>
              
              <p>It’s used by the Django admin site, but you’re welcome to use it in your own code.</p>
              <p>The Django admin site uses permissions as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                
              <li>Access to view objects is limited to users with the “view” or “change” permission for that type of object.</li>  
              <li>Access to view the “add” form and add an object is limited to users with the “add” permission for that type of object.</li>
              <li>Access to view the change list, view the “change” form and change an object is limited to users with the “change” permission for that type of object. </li>
              <li>Access to delete an object is limited to users with the “delete” permission for that type of object.</li>
              
              </ul>
              <p>Permissions can be set not only per type of object, but also per specific object instance. By using the has_view_permission(), has_add_permission(), has_change_permission() and has_delete_permission() methods provided by the ModelAdmin class, it is possible to customize permissions for different object instances of the same type.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Authentication in web requests</h3>
            
            <p>Django uses sessions and middleware to hook the authentication system into request objects.</p>
              
              <p>These provide a request.user attribute on every request which represents the current user. If the current user has not logged in, this attribute will be set to an instance of AnonymousUser, otherwise it will be an instance of User.</p>
              <p>You can tell them apart with <strong>is_authenticated</strong></p>

             <h4>How to log a user in</h4> 
             <p>If you have an authenticated user you want to attach to the current session - this is done with a login() function.</p>
             <p><strong>login(request, user, backend=None)</strong></p>

             <h4>How to log a user out</h4> 
             <p><strong>logout(request)</strong></p>
