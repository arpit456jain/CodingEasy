            <p>Decision Tree is a Regression & Classification Algorithm. When used for Regression it's called Decision
                Tree Regressor & when it's used for Classification it's called Decision Tree Classifier.</p>
            <p>The concept is based on a hierarchical data structure which is called Tree. We have nodes and edges as
                shown. The algotihm gives good results when we have to do multi class classification.</p>
            <p>Each node represents a question on which decision tree devides the datapoint as to where it should send
                the datapoint for further questions either in left subtree or right subtree. Only the leaf nodes
                represents the classes of the problem
                statement. If there are n nodes then there are n-1 edges.</p>
            <p>Like here we have to classify whether a species is Bird/Fish/Mammals. so the 1st question 1st we are
                classifying on the basis of whether the animal breathes in water/air. On the basis of this question we
                are classifying whether the animal
                is Fish or not fish. Then we go to the 2nd question stating whether the animal lays eggs or not. And on
                the basis of this we can classify the animal as Bird or Other Mammals.
