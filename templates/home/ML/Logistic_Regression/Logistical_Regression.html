            <p>Logistic Regression is a Classification algorithm which is mostly used for Binary Classification problems
                which includes 2 classes/categories</p>
            <p>This algorithm is named after the term "Regression" because it is the only Classification algorithm which
                uses the mathematical concept very similar to Linear Regression</p>
            <p>This algorithm is widely used in classifying problems like if image is cat/dog or any sentence is
                spam/ham etc.</p>
            <p>As shown in the plot the circle markers(Blue Dots) are actual values and the best fit line(Red Line)
                represents the predicted values. Also there are 2 class values represented by 0 & 1. If a straight line
                is taken like Linear Regression
                then most of the points will be missed whereas if an S shaped curve called Sigmoid Curve is taken then
                most points are covered.
            </p>
            <p>After this we try to find the error which is the difference between predicted and actual value. We also
                try to minimize the error and thus adjust the best fit line so that we get minimum error. Once we get
                the perfect best fit line for
                our problem then we are all good to go for predicting unknown values.
