            <p>We have a hierarchy of clusters formed under this algorithm.</p>
            <p>Suppose we have 4 datapoints - P1,P2,P3,P4. Within them P1 & P2 are most similar points so they are
                grouped under a same cluster. And they are grouped under a bigger cluster.</P>
            <P>We can represent the hierarchy of the clusters using a diagram as shown called Dendogram. In the
                dendogram we can see that P1 & P2 are most similar and then they are similar with P3. And their
                combination is similar with P4. We have to
                keep on forming clusters until we are left with only 1 big clusters and all the datapoints are covered.
