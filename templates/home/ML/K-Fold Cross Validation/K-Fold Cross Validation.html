            <p>Cross validation is a statistical method that helps in evaluating the performance of the 
                model. For example, if we are creating ML models for classifying whether emails are spam or not.</p>
            <p>In order to train a model in such a way, we use whatever label data we have and once the model is built, 
                we test it using different datassets. Model will return us different reult when we compare with the 
                truth to measure accuracy.</p>
            <p>The k value in K-Fold Cross Validation refers to the number of groups that are to be formed. This is
                done by splitting the data sample into 'k' number of groups. Hence, the k value must be chosen 
                carefully for the data sample.</p>
            <p>The model training can be done in the following ways:
                1. Use all the available data for training and test the model on the same dataset. Here
                   we are using 100% of the samples for testing the model as well as using the same 
                   exit samples to test the model.
                2. Split the available datasets into training and testing sets.
                3. K-Fold Cross Validation, where we divide our samples into folds. After that we run multiple
                   iterations. For example, we can use the first fold for testing the model, rest for training.
                   Then we can use only the second fold for testing, other for training. The process can be 
                   repeated till the last fold. After that, we have the scores of each and average them out. 
            <p>A basic example is demonstrated below:
            from sklearn.model_selection import KFold #using k_fold api
            kf = KFold(n_splits=3) #n_splits=3 is used to give how many fols you want to create, here it is 3
            kf</p>
            <p>sklearn has cross_val_score to test the scores of different models.
                Command:
                from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
            </p>
