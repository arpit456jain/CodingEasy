                    <h3><b><i>Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and they
                        are called literals.
    
                        Constants can be of any of the basic data types and can be divided into Integer Numerals,
                        Floating-Point Numerals, Characters, Strings and Boolean Values.
    
                        Again, constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified
                        after their definition.</i></b></h3></p>

                    <h3>Integer Literals</h3> An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A
                    prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.

                    An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long,
                    respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
                    <br>
                    212 // Legal
                    <br>
                    215u // Legal
                    <br>
                    0xFeeL // Legal
                    <br>
                    078 // Illegal: 8 is not an octal digit
                    <br>
                    032UU // Illegal: cannot repeat a suffix
                    <br>
                    Following are other examples of various types of Integer literals −
                    <br>
                    85 // decimal
                    <br>
                    0213 // octal
                    <br>
                    0x4b // hexadecimal
                    <br>
                    30 // int
                    <br>
                    30u // unsigned int
                    <br>
                    30l // long
                    <br>
                    30ul // unsigned long
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Floating-point Literals</h3>
                    A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent
                    part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.

                    While representing using decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both and
                    while representing using exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part,
                    or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.

                    Here are some examples of floating-point literals −
                    <br>
                    3.14159 // Legal
                    <br>
                    314159E-5L // Legal
                    <br>
                    510E // Illegal: incomplete exponent
                    <br>
                    210f // Illegal: no decimal or exponent
                    <br>
                    .e55 // Illegal: missing integer or fraction
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Boolean Literals</h3>
                    There are two Boolean literals and they are part of standard C++ keywords −
                    <ul>A value of <b>true</b> representing true.</ul>
                    <ul>A value of <b>false</b> representing false.</ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Character Literals</h3>
                    Character literals are enclosed in single quotes. If the literal begins with L (uppercase only), it
                    is a wide character literal (e.g., L'x') and should be stored in wchar_t type of variable .
                    Otherwise, it is a narrow character literal (e.g., 'x') and can be stored in a simple variable of
                    char type.

                    A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a
                    universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').

                    There are certain characters in C++ when they are preceded by a backslash they will have special
                    meaning and they are used to represent like newline (\n) or tab (\t).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>String Literals</h3>
                    String literals are enclosed in double quotes. A string contains characters that are similar to
                    character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.

                    You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separate them using
                    whitespaces.

                    Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
                    <br>
                    "hello, dear"
                     <br>
                    "hello, \
                     <br>
                    dear"
                     <br>
                    "hello, " "d" "ear"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Defining Constants</h3>
                    There are two simple ways in C++ to define constants −
                    <ul>Using <b>#define</b> preprocessor.</ul>
                    <ul>Using <b>const</b> keyword.</ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The #define Preprocessor</h3>
                    #define identifier value
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The const Keyword</h3>
                    const type variable = value;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            </p>
        </div>
